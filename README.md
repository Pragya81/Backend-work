# Backend-work
et up an Express backend with AdminJS for managing FAQs. Implemented CRUD API routes for FAQs and wrote unit tests using Mocha/Chai. Integrated MongoDB, configured environment variables, and used Git for version control. Created a README with setup instructions and API examples for easy use and contribution.
